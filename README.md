**Data Structures and Algorithms in python**

An introduction to data structures and algorithms in python. Using this project, different 
data structures and algorithms are studied and tested. 

The project aims to understand the complexity of these algorithms based on space and time 
to understand the efficiencies and inefficiencies in the algorithms.

Different solutions are proposed to different common problems and their complexity is measured 
and written down as Big O notation.
